## **Introduction**

I like to draft designs on paper before firing up CAD but this requires keeping a small amount of tools on my desk. Now, there are already plenty of solutions for drawing utensil organizing but sometimes I just feel like making something, even if unnecessary.

This page will go through the steps I went through to design and build a minimal _smart_ drafting tool organizer. Why 'smart?' Well why not! Everything is nowadays.
