## **Introduction**

SSVL is my own stereo vision library I made for fun. This article only explains how stereo vision works and what my library does, but not how to use it.

See the `README.md` [here](https://github.com/jmdevy/simple_stereo_vision_lib) on how to use the `C` library in your own project.
