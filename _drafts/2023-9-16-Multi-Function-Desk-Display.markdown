## Introduction

An easy project I've had for a while is to create a multi-functional display device that sits on your desk and displays information about weather (current temperature, closest radar map data to your location, etc.), planes overhead, calendar, etc. Since it will sit on a desk it does not need a battery and can just stay plugged in.

Based on the above ideas, the following aspects of the device need to be designed and built:
* Enclosure and Size
* Screen
* Power delivery
* Connectivity (WiFi Provisioning)
* User interaction

## Enclosure and Size

## Screen

## Power Delivery

## Connectivity and Provisioning

## User Interaction


Instead of using a OLED or LCD screen, the device will consist of individual RGB LEDs in an enclosure with pockets to separate the individual lights. At the top of the pockets will be some material to diffuse the light from the RGBs.
