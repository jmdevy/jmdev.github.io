### Introduction
---
The Korad KA3005P power supply is a cheap 30V 5A programmable module with a serial interface. This serial interface can be used to change or read most parameters on the module.

The idea behind this web app is to provide nearly limitless memory recall profiles, naming, and to provide a clearer understanding of what the module parameters are for.


### Power Supply Documentation
---
Files for the serial command and user manual documentation can be found at the following locations:
* [**KA Series Single Channel Remote Control Syntax V4.0.pdf**](https://github.com/jmdevy/KORAD-KA3005P-WEBAPP/blob/1977ce19c9e7fad0e55e786668e3cac96fdfd884/assets/KA%20Series%20Single%20Channel%20Remote%20Control%20Syntax%20V4.0.pdf){:target="_blank"}
* [**KA3000-6000 Series User Manual.pdf**](https://github.com/jmdevy/KORAD-KA3005P-WEBAPP/blob/1977ce19c9e7fad0e55e786668e3cac96fdfd884/assets/KA3000-6000%20Series%20User%20Manual.pdf){:target="_blank"}

These were extracted from the CD that came with the power supply or scanned manually.
